# Co-prime numbers

**Co-prime numbers**, also known as **relatively prime numbers**, are two or more integers that have **no common positive integer factors other than 1**. This means their **greatest common divisor (GCD)** is **1**.

### Key Characteristics:
1. **Definition**: Two numbers $a$ and $b$ are co-prime if $\gcd(a, b) = 1$.
2. **Examples**:
    - $8$ and $15$: Factors of 8 are ${1, 2, 4, 8}$; factors of 15 are ${1, 3, 5, 15}$. Only common factor is 1 → **co-prime**.
    - $12$ and $18$: Common factors include 1, 2, 3, 6 → **not co-prime**.
3. **Special Cases**:
    - **1** is co-prime with every number because $\gcd(1, n) = 1$ for any integer $n$.
    - **Consecutive integers** (e.g., $14$ and $15$) are always co-prime, as their difference is 1, making any common divisor divide 1.
    - **Prime numbers** are co-prime with any number that is not a multiple of them (e.g., $7$ and $10$).

### Properties:
- **Not necessarily prime**: Co-prime numbers do not have to be prime (e.g., $8$ and $15$).
- **Negative numbers**: Co-prime relationships apply to negative integers as well (e.g., $-8$ and $-15$).
- **Applications**:
  - **Fractions**: If the numerator and denominator are co-prime, the fraction is in its **simplest form**.
  - **Modular arithmetic**: If $a$ and $b$ are co-prime, $a$ has a **modular inverse** modulo $b$.

### Related Concepts:
- **Euclidean Algorithm**: A method to compute the GCD of two numbers, useful for determining co-primality.
- **Mutually Prime**: Synonymous with co-prime, emphasizing the mutual lack of common factors.

### Summary:
Co-prime numbers are integers that share no common factors other than 1. This relationship is fundamental in number theory, algebra, and applications like simplifying fractions and solving congruences.
