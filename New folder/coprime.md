# Co-prime numbers

**Co-prime numbers**, also known as **relatively prime numbers**, are two or more integers that have **no common positive integer factors other than 1**. This means their **greatest common divisor (GCD)** is **1**.

### Key Characteristics:
1. **Definition**: Two numbers \( a \) and \( b \) are co-prime if \( \gcd(a, b) = 1 \).
2. **Examples**:
   - \( 8 \) and \( 15 \): Factors of 8 are \( \{1, 2, 4, 8\} \); factors of 15 are \( \{1, 3, 5, 15\} \). Only common factor is 1 → **co-prime**.
   - \( 12 \) and \( 18 \): Common factors include 1, 2, 3, 6 → **not co-prime**.
3. **Special Cases**:
   - **1** is co-prime with every number because \( \gcd(1, n) = 1 \) for any integer \( n \).
   - **Consecutive integers** (e.g., \( 14 \) and \( 15 \)) are always co-prime, as their difference is 1, making any common divisor divide 1.
   - **Prime numbers** are co-prime with any number that is not a multiple of them (e.g., \( 7 \) and \( 10 \)).

### Properties:
- **Not necessarily prime**: Co-prime numbers do not have to be prime (e.g., \( 8 \) and \( 15 \)).
- **Negative numbers**: Co-prime relationships apply to negative integers as well (e.g., \( -8 \) and \( -15 \)).
- **Applications**:
  - **Fractions**: If the numerator and denominator are co-prime, the fraction is in its **simplest form**.
  - **Modular arithmetic**: If \( a \) and \( b \) are co-prime, \( a \) has a **modular inverse** modulo \( b \).

### Related Concepts:
- **Euclidean Algorithm**: A method to compute the GCD of two numbers, useful for determining co-primality.
- **Mutually Prime**: Synonymous with co-prime, emphasizing the mutual lack of common factors.

### Summary:
Co-prime numbers are integers that share no common factors other than 1. This relationship is fundamental in number theory, algebra, and applications like simplifying fractions and solving congruences.
